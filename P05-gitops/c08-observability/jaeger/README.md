# Jaeger All-In-One Kubernetes Deployment

This Jaeger Kubernetes deployment manifest is based on the following original manifest provided by the Jaeger project. It should only be used for running Jaeger on minikube for educational and testing purposes, not in a production environment.

The above repository has been archived since the recommended way of installing and managing Jaeger in a production Kubernetes cluster is via the [Jaeger Operator](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-operator).
